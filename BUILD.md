#Building LibLSLCC and LSLCCEditor On Windows

 
LibLSLCC requires Java to be installed so that the ANTLR 4 parser generator tool 
can be run as part of the pre-build step for the LibLSLCC Library.  

The java executable will need to be in your PATH so that it can run from the command prompt. 
Fortunately installing java itself sets this up for you by default.


In order to build the **LibLSLCC-WithEditor-WithInstaller.sln** solution on Windows you must 
install the WiX Installer Toolset from http://wixtoolset.org/.  WiX will integrate with Visual Studio 
and allow you to load the WiX Project type, so you can build the **LSLCCEditorInstaller** project that
is part of this particular solution file.


All C# projects in the solution can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio Express/Comunity Edition 2015.


**LSLCCEditor** and **LSLCCEditor.CompletionUI** are only buildable on Windows as they depend on WPF and AvalonEdit, 
but the **LibLSLCC** project and related projects are cross platform.  

Additionally **LSLCCEditor** and **LSLCCEditor.CompletionUI** can only be built in versions of Visual Studio 
that support targeting the .NET 4.5 framework.

I have not tested other versions of Visual Studio besides VS2010 with the **LSLCCEditor** portion of the build.
VS2010 for sure **does not work**, as the editor uses a .NET framework level (4.5) that is too high for it to compile, 
and WiX v3.10.1 does not support integration with VS2010.


If you happen to be using a version of Visual Studio that is incompatible with **WiX** or the **LSLCCEditor** portion of the
build, and you just want to build the library portion of the project;  You can use **LibLSLCC-NoEditor.sln**.


It contains only the library project and projects from the source tree which have a .NET 4.0 compatibility profile.
The projects in the **LibLSLCC-NoEditor.sln** solution have been tested with VS2010 so far, they will most likely
build with every version of Visual Studio starting with VS2010.
 


#Building LibLSLCC on *Nix Platforms with monodevelop 


Use **LibLSLCC-NoEditor.sln** when building for Mono.
 
Only the LibLSLCC, LibraryDataScrapingTools, lslcc_cmd and DemoArea projects are buildable on Mono 
and the **LibLSLCC-NoEditor.sln** includes only these projects for convenience.

Java is also required when building on *Nix platforms so that the ANTRL 4 tool can run.  
Make sure you have the latest version of Java available for your distribution installed and
that it is runnable from the command line.
 
You can open the provided **LibLSLCC-NoEditor.sln** solution on Linux using the latest version of MonoDevelop,
Or you can build it from the command line using the xbuild command (See the next section).
 
Other than some of the projects in the solution being un-buildable under Mono, the build on *Nix platforms behaves
the exact same way under xbuild/monodevelop as it does under MSBuild on Windows.


#Building LibLSLCC on *Nix Platforms with xbuild from the shell


To build LibLSLCC from the command line using mono and xbuild on nix platforms, first install Mono 
for your distribution then CD into the LibLSLCC source tree where **LibLSLCC-NoEditor.sln** resides.

enter the command:

	xbuild /p:Configuration=Release LibLSLCC-NoEditor.sln
	

LibLSLCC should start building.
