The LibLSLCC Library was designed to be a drop in replacement for OpenSim's default compiler, 
LibLSLCC implements an true compiler for LSL with full front end syntax checking, true to Linden LSL 
Operator precedence replication in generated code, and compatibility fixes for issues that the  
default OpenSim compiler and LSL runtime suffers from. 
 
The LibLSLCC compiler also provides helpful extended syntax warnings, errors and code validations not present in the Linden compiler. 
 
A working build of OpenSim using this compiler is currently in my private repositories, and will be public after a few 
checks and updates. 
 
 
A nearly full featured LSL Editor with context aware auto complete, go to definition (navigation by symbol), code formatting and library data
for both Linden SecondLife and Opensim SecondLife is included.  It was built to test the compiler originally but has developed into a full blown multi tabbed IDE.
 
 
Happy coding. 
 
Note:  
        This solution contains an installer project for the code editor which requires  
        the WiX Toolset to build.  see: http://wixtoolset.org/ for the WiX Toolset download 
        if your having trouble building the installer project.
