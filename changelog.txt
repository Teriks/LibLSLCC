# (1/26/2016 ...) Event handler cleanup / URL colors

Cleaned up event handler parameter names so that they formatted more traditionally when generating handlers using autocomplete.

They were previously capitalized due to the source the library data was scraped from.

Changing the highlighting color of URL's in source code from the theme editor pane is now possible.

Its at: `Settings -> Editor Theme -> Syntax Highlighting / Editor Color -> Urls`

# (1/31/2016 ...) Fix to code formatter

Fixed an issue with formatting braceless conditional/loop expressions containing comments before the
single statement that makes up the code body.

Previously code such as this:


```LSL

if(TRUE)
    //test
    llOwnerSay("test");

```

Was being formatted like this, when the 'Indent Braceless Control Statements'
option was disabled in the formatter settings:


```LSL

if(TRUE) //test llOwnerSay("test");

```

This is of course a syntax error,  braceless expressions with any sort of comments
preceding the body expression are now forcefully indented regardless of the indent
settings for braceless control/loop statements.

# (1/31/2016 ...) Code generation change

Remove unnecessary code generation for implicit boolean conversions of vector/rotation/list and string

# (2/4/2016 7:44AM) Fix improper code generation issue


Expression statements such as:

~(x=0);

-(x=0);

(unary op) (expression);


and:


(x=3);

(basically any expression in parenthesis as statement);


Were not being accounted for when compiling to CSharp.

CSharp does not allow anything but variable declarations,
variable assignments/modifications, and method calls to be used
as a standalone statement.  You cannot have a unary expression or 
parenthesized expression be a standalone statement.

Therefore these valid LSL expressions must be sanitized when compiling.

This fixed simply by forcing them to become an argument to a generic
function that does nothing.

public static void ForceStatement<T>(T value){}
